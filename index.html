        <p>Cox's Bazar (Bengali: কক্সবাজার, romanized: Kaksabājāra; pronounced [kɔksbadʒaɾ]) is a city, fishing port, tourism centre, and district headquarters in southeastern Bangladesh. It is located 150 km (93 mi) south of the city of Chittagong. Cox's Bazar is also known by the name Panowa, which translates literally as "yellow flower". Another old name was "Palongkee". The city has the longest uninterrupted natural beach in the world.[2]

            The modern Cox's Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the British East India Company, a Superintendent of Palongkee outpost. To commemorate his role in refugee rehabilitation work, a market was established and named after him.</p>
